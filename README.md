👋 Hello folks! I'm enryjver.  
I'm a 15yo (going for 16 :D) professional dumbass from italy 🇮🇹.  
🎓 Currently studying in Ravenna, and looking to get into those pretty appealing Computer Science classes. And maybe even graduate. Btw, i suck at maths, but like, officially suck.  
Aaand that's it. I feel like I already gave enough info to some random strangers on the internet.
